# Step by Step approach

## Data Collection and Preparation

1. Data Collection and Preparation

1.1. Gather Transcripts 📜
Objective: Collect transcripts from approximately 400 episodes of Lex Fridman's YouTube channel:

Method: Use automated tools or manual methods to extract and store transcripts in a structured format.

1.2. Data Cleaning 🧹
Objective: Ensure data quality by cleaning the transcripts.
Method: Remove any irrelevant content, correct errors, and standardize formatting.

1.3. Data Structuring 🗃️
Objective: Organize transcripts for efficient processing.
Method: Structure data into a format suitable for language model training (e.g., JSON, CSV).

## 2. Tokenization of Text 🔠

2.1. Text Segmentation
Objective: Break down the transcripts into smaller units (tokens), such as words, subwords, or characters.

2.2. Vocabulary Building
Objective: Create a vocabulary of tokens that the model will use.
Method: Use techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece for subword tokenization.

2.3. Token Mapping
Objective: Map each token to a unique numerical identifier.

2.4. Sequence Management
Objective: Ensure that the tokenized sequences fit within the model's maximum input length.
Method: Handle any necessary padding or truncation.

## 3. Model Selection and Fine-Tuning

3.1. Select a Pre-trained Language Model 🤖
Objective: Choose a robust pre-trained model as the foundation.
Example: LLaMA-4 or llama-3 (Large Language Model by Meta AI).

3.2. Fine-Tune the Model 🎛️
Objective: Adapt the pre-trained model to understand and generate responses based on the transcript data.
Method: Fine-tune the model using supervised learning on the prepared transcript dataset.

## 4. Develop the Chatbot Framework

4.1. Backend Development 🖥️
Objective: Create the server-side logic for the chatbot.
Method: Use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to handle API requests and integrate with the language model.

4.2. Frontend Development with Streamlit 💻
Objective: Design a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
Method: Develop a web interface using Streamlit, which allows for rapid development of interactive web applications in Python.
